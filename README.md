# Edelta_bad_smells
Edelta libraries for bad smell detection and refactorings

To test this project first install Edelta, either in an existing Eclipse or by downloading one of our Eclipse distributions (the details can be found here: https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/edelta/blob/master/README.md)

Then clone this project and import it in the Eclipse with Edelta installed.

You can uncomment statements in the Main.java file, or add an explicit "experiment" method invocation with one of our models (that are stored in the "model" source directory). You can see the output in the Console, and then the modified Ecore in the "modified" directory - you need to "Refresh" the "modified" directory after running the Main file.
